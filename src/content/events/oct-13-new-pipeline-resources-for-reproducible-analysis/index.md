Computational pipelines have become one of the most central methodological components of modern biology. Their capacity to support reproducible scientific analysis defines the very foundation of contemporary science. In this talk, I will introduce a new paper collection dedicated to computational pipelines. This collection will appear in the journal  NAR Bioinformatics and Genomics (NAR GAB). NAR GAB is a sister title of Nucleic Acids Research with a special focus on methods and reproducibility in computational biology. The pipeline collection will be open to all platforms and all technologies. Submissions will be reviewed under the same scrutiny as any other type of scientific contribution. One of its objectives will be to engage various communities such as FAANG – the animal genomics community – or GA4GH and encourage large-scale interoperability between pipelines, reference datasets, and benchmark methods.
