Bioinformatics is experiencing a big bang metamorphosis. With exponential growth of -omics data, rapidly increasing venture capital flows into biotechnology and a stunning array of high throughput applications, the need for extraordinary bioinformatics infrastructure is greater than ever before. Excelling at bioinformatics infrastructure, alongside disruption of classic healthcare and cloud computing benefitting healthcare tremendously through automation, scalability and extensibility of care.

Here, we share how we have set up bioinformatics infrastructure leveraging nextflow, cloud computing and healthcare at scale . We provide an architecture which has been used to analyze tens of thousands of  SARS-CoV-2 genomes in an automated, scalable and elastic manner.
